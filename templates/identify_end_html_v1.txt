# Task: Locate the last paragraph in this book

Carefully examine this final section of a book in HTML format:

```html
${context}
```

Identify the last paragraph where the main narrative (or factual content for non-fiction) ends and any "end matter" section(s) begin:

- IGNORE IRRELEVANT SECTIONS: Exclude all "end matter" sections such as appendices, indexes, glossaries, author biographies, reading group guides, advertisements, or other supplementary material.
- USE THE CONTEXT: Search for phrases like "The End", "Epilogue", or "Conclusion". If there is an index, check if it provides any hints about where the main content ends.
- LOOK FOR CLUES: For each candidate paragraph, examine the subsequent line for indications of "end matter" section headings. Look for elements like HTML header tags, bold formatting, or text in all caps.
- BE CAUTIOUS: The provided final book section may not actually contain the end of the content. Don't assume it does!

Respond using this JSON format:

```json
{
  "candidates": ["string1", "string2", "string3"],
  "analysis": "string",
  "last_paragraph": "string"|null
}
```

1. The `candidates` array should list all paragraphs that you think could potentially be the last paragraph of the main content.
2. The `analysis` string should explain how you considered each candidate in relation to the subsequent line to come up with your final decision.
3. `last_paragraph` should be your best guess from the considered candidates, or `null` if still too unsure.

**IMPORTANT**: Don't set `last_paragraph` unless you are reasonably confident you have successfully identified the correct closing paragraph!!!
