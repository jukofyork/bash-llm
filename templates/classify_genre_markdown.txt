# Task: Determine if this book is fiction or nonfiction

Examine both the beginning and ending sections of this book:

```text
${start_context}
```

```text
${end_context}
```

Analyze the text to determine if this is fiction or nonfiction. Look for these key indicators:

FICTION indicators:
- Narrative scenes with dialogue and character interactions
- Descriptions of characters' thoughts and feelings
- Story-like plot elements and dramatic scenes
- Use of literary devices like metaphors and vivid descriptions
- Events that appear imagined rather than documented

NONFICTION indicators:
- Facts, dates, and real historical events
- Academic or technical language
- Citations or references to sources
- Explanatory or instructional tone
- Discussion of real people, places or concepts
- Analytical or argumentative structure

Note: Focus only on distinguishing between fiction and nonfiction. Do not get distracted by specific genres (like romance, mystery, biography, textbook etc).

Respond using this JSON format:

```json
{
    "analysis": "string",
    "genre": "fiction"|"nonfiction"|"unknown"
}
```

Guidelines:
- In your analysis, cite specific examples from the text that support your classification.
- Only classify as "fiction" or "nonfiction" if you are reasonably confident and can see clear evidence.
- Use "unknown" if the evidence is ambiguous or insufficient.
